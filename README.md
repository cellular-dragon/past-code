# Single-cell-phenotype-analysis
The codes used to analyze the phenotype information (cell cycle length, division asynchrony, division asymmetry, CND-1 expression, division angle and relative cell position) of C. elegans embryos from 4D live imaging. And phenotypic information can be used to analyze the robustness of cell development, please refer to Xiao et. al., 2022 for detailed analysis methods.

You can download the raw data from "". And performing data analysis in sequence according to the numbering sequence of the script and the files that need to be input inside.
