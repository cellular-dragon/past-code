# Single-cell-phenotype-analysis
The codes used to analyze the phenotype information (cell cycle length, division asynchrony, division asymmetry, CND-1 expression, division angle and relative cell position) of C. elegans embryos from 4D live imaging.

And phenotypic information can be used to analyze the robustness of cell development as in Xiao et al., 2022.

You can download the raw data from "".
